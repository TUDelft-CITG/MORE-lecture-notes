# How does the questionnaire for an structure expert judgment elicitation look like?

A questionnaire for an elicitation using Cooke's method contains two types of questions:

- **Seed or calibration questions**. Questions whose answer is or will be known by the analyst. For instance, if I am interested in air temperature, I might ask about the maximum daily temperature next Saturday. I might also want to use data from field or laboratory campaigns that are unknown by the experts.
- **Questions of interest**. Questions whose answer is unknown and are the main outcome of the elicitation: the variables we want to quantify.

For each question, the expert is asked to give some percentiles, typically three: 5\%, 50\%, and 95\%. From now on, we are going to assume that these three percentiles are elicited but note that it can be extended to a higher number of percentiles. 

Recall that 5\% percentile represents the realization of the random variable (values) whose non-exceedance probability is 0.05. Therefore, the 5\% percentile represents the quantity **below** which the expert thinks it is very unlikely to find the realization of the random variable. The 95\% represents then the quantity **above** which the expert thinks it is very unlikely to find the realization of the random variable.

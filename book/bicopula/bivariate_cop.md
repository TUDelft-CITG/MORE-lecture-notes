## Bivariate Copulas
To statistically describe dependent variables, we rely on the following components:

- **Marginal distributions**:  
  $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(y)$, which describe the univariate behavior of $X$ and $Y$, respectively.  

- **Joint density function**:  
  $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$, which models the joint occurrence of the pair $(X, Y)$.  

- **Conditional distributions**:  
  $f(x \mid y_0)$ and $f(y \mid x_0)$, which describe the distribution of one variable (e.g., 
  $X$) when conditioned on a specific value of the other (e.g., $Y = y_0$).  

Together, these components form the foundation for analyzing and modeling multivariate dependencies, serving as a bridge between univariate analysis and more advanced multivariate statistical modeling

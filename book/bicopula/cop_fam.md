# Copula Families

In univariate analysis, we can describe data using parametric (theoretical) distribution functions or construct empirical distributions directly from observed data. The same principles extend naturally to the multivariate setting. 

Parametric copula families provide flexible tools to model and describe a wide range of dependence structures among multiple variables, capturing relationships that go beyond simple correlations. At the same time, empirical copulas allow us to construct joint distributions directly from data without assuming a specific parametric form, generalizing the familiar idea of empirical distributions from the univariate case. 

Together, parametric and empirical approaches form the foundation for modelling and describing dependence in multivariate data.

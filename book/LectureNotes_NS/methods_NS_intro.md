# Statistical Modelling under the Non Stationary assumptions

We now explore two approaches to statistical modelling for time series that exhibit trends or patterns.

In the first approach, i.e., *detrending approach*, we separate the deterministic and stochastic components and develop a statistical model only for the stochastic component. In the second approach, i.e., *integrated approach*, the deterministic component is incorporated directly into the statistical model. We apply the latter approach to extreme value analysis and review examples from the scientific literature.

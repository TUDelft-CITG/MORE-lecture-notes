# Statistical Modelling unders the Non Stationary assumptions

We will now explore two approaches to statistical modelling when time series present trends  or patterns. 

In the first approach, i.e., *detrending approach*, we separate the deterministic and stochastic components and develop a statistical model only for the stochastic component. In the second approach, i.e., *integrated approach*, the deterministic component is incorporated directly into the statistical model. We will apply the latter approach to extreme value analysis and review examples from the scientific literature.

(And yes, the name of the contributor in first place was indeed a [Rick Roll](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ))

## The winners

Our **winners** in the category **ensemble mean RMSE** were:

🥇 **1st place**: Simon van Leent / Rick Roll (particle filter)

🥈 **2nd place**: Hakan Zor / Zorro (ensemble Kalman filter)

🥉 **3rd place**: Bagas Mahadika A. P. (particle filter)

Our 𝘄𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 in the category 𝗲𝗻𝘀𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗹𝗲 𝗥𝗠𝗦𝗘 are:

🥇 **1st place**: Simon van Leent / Rick Roll (particle filter)

🥈 **2nd place**: Bagas Mahadika A. P. (particle filter)

🥉 **3rd place**: Daniel van der Hoorn / Lightning McQueen (particle filter)

Honorable mentions go to Anne Grooten (particle filter), whose filter maintained a solid second place until it tragically diverged in the last 25 timesteps of the (unseen) validation period. Truly an emotional rollercoaster. 

## The model

So, what was the model actually doing? The true dynamics follow several steps:

1) Initialization: Place a random circle in the domain. 

2) Move a random arc distance along the circle’s circumference. 

3) Create a new circle which shares a tangent with the old circle. Switch the path over to the new circle. Return to step 2.

A demonstration of this principle is shown below:

The true model followed a circle, and randomly switched to a new circle that shares a tangent.
